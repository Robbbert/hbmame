This document is best read with Notepad.

The purpose of this document is to state the names of WINUI authors, disclaimers, and licence conditions.

WINUI is a set of codes which add a 'front-end' facility to the MAME emulator (and certain derivatives).
It is not maintained or supported by MAMEdev, but by the efforts of dedicated individuals.
The files are normally found in the src/osd/winui folder(s) of a source package.

WINUI was originally written around 1997, and has had contributions from many authors, both known and unknown.
Due to the lack of historical records, it is unknown who exactly contributed what.

Here is the list of known authors, and the known licence for them:
