 the machine config to set the default BIOS for a slot card device.
 [Curt Coder]

-diserial: Remove defines, cleanup clocks/timers, add sync support [O. Galibert]

-verified The Gladiator internal ROM on an Overseas cart [Artemio Urbina]

-wd_fdc: Set CRC error bit if CRC error found during Read Address
 command. Tiki 100 determines whether the disk is in FM or MFM format
 by checking this. [Curt Coder]

 * Dumped and added IOB2.11D to sf2ee and sf2ue [Porchy], S9263B.1A to
    sf2ce and sf2hf sets and clones [Porchy], CP1B9KA.9K to pang3
    [Zabanitu]

-snk6502.c:  Adjusted Nibbler board clock rate to use actual known
 master clock and a logical divisor.  [Tafoid]

 MMX. [Barry Rodewald]

-Fixed a complement by two bug in V9958 YJK table, fixes for good
 colors in Puzzle Star / Sexy Boom / some MSX2+ games. [Angelo Salese]

-Kludged Puzzle Star (Sang Ho Soft) hang at title screen [Angelo Salese]

-Added the SHA1 for System 573 700B01 now that we have a dump. It
 currently expects a different response from the H8 at bootup than the
 other BIOS versions, so the data is stored in a fake rom until it's
 HLE'd better of we get a dump of the H8 internal rom
 [smf, innocent2k, anthonyoftga]

-document that ketsui roms exist with different fill in the unused
 areas [Artemio Urbina]

-upd765: Fixed sense drive status command, and allow floppy connectors
 without drives. [Curt Coder]

-Reduce smearing on hlsl prescale [MooglyGuy]

-Corrected 7486 description in head file [MASH]

-various PGM protection cleanups / fixes (orlegend, olds, svgpcb) [iq_132]

-finished modernising i2cmem [smf]

-remodernised x76f041/x76f100 & zs01 so that logging becomes easy again
 & uses READ_LINE_MEMBER/WRITE_LINE_MEMBER so the pins can be bound to
 directly. Hooked up x76f041 to the early beatmania IIDX games. They
 all pass the security check eventually but it takes a long time as it
 repeatedly reads the first byte, it's possible that the contents
 aren't correct as the game says the security is OK even when the data
 returned is not what it's checking for. [smf]

-Added a work round so that CR589 firmware updating works again, either
 from the separate CD's or as part of the game install (for example DDR
 MAX). [smf]

-playch10: update Playchoice-10 BIOS ROM names to match exact chip
 labels and types [Dead_Body]

-naomi/dc: Sanitize screen format, fixes MT5349 [O. Galibert]

-redumped some System 573 CD's [Guru]

-CPS-1 update: Added S222B.1A PAL to ffightj and clones. 
 [Charles MacDonald, Porchy, Smitdogg, The Dumping Union]

-Created DS1204 device & switched megatouch to use it instead of it's
 own local version (driver could do with some more tidying up as not
 all games use a key but currently it is hooked up to all games).
 Default data comes from a region instead of coded in driver, commands
 & security match are now compared, data is clocked on the correct
 edge, key can be written to and is saved to nvram. [smf]

-redumped bad roms for First Funky Fighter [Yohji, Smitdogg, The Dumping Union]

-Merged othldrby.c with toaplan2.c driver [Angelo Salese]

-Converted Toaplan 2 to use SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS [Angelo Salese]

-Added a core for uPD4992 RTC, used by Othello Derby and Power Kick [Angelo Salese]

-Hooked up ds1204, but haven't found what it checks for yet. Change
 PATCH_PROTECTION to 0 in tmaster.c and VERBOSE_LEVEL to 2 in ds1204.c
 then look for "-> command" in error.log to find the subsequent read
 from the dq pin for reading the identification and secure memory. For
 tm4k the first two bytes of the nvram need to be  0x00, 0xa0. From
 scratch you'll need to play a game before it will complain about the
 protection, but after that it will complain on every boot. It tries
 five different contents for the compare register at various points
 during the bootup, this may be for obfuscation as the real chip will
 return random results if the key is wrong. If the keys are available
 it might be easier to dump them than figure out exactly what it wants.
 [smf]

-svgpcb: added igs027a rom, runs intro, dies trying to go in game, not
 sure why yet [rtw, David Haywood]

-Created a skeleton for the Konami 573 Multi Session Unit, renamed
 digital io board source file to match and moved pcb layout from
 driver. [smf]

-Added skeleton for konami 573 memory card reader and network pcb unit
 devices [smf]

-redumped keyboard mania 3 [Guru]

-Updated konam80s atapi dma kludge so that Guitar Freaks 7th Mix (and
 alot of others) load again [smf] 

-Mambo A GO-GO CD redump in raw mode + raw subcode. [any]

-Improved Sega Bloxeed dipswitches. [Zaphod]

-Added basic 3d FIFO understanding and hooked up FIFO irq processed to
 Hyper Neo Geo 64, meaning a far better 3d display in all games
 [Angelo Salese]

-mc2661: Added various transmission and reception logic to help make
 the above possible [Barry Rodewald]

-twin16.c: [Alex Jackson]
 * Use the correct gfx ROMs for all the vulcan/gradius2 sets
 * Load gfx ROMs using standard macros instead of custom postprocessing
 * Replace custom read/write handlers with AM_REGION, AM_SHARE, or banks as appropriate
 * Fix Extra Life dipswitches in vulcana and vulcanb
 * Fix cuebrick NVRAM size
 * Fix audio cpu RAM size
 * Use XTALs for clocks

-Windows: Fixed D3D multimonitor support. [GroovyMAME]

-Slot options can now be configured inline without creating an array.
 Legacy support for old configuration uses MCFG_FRAGMENT_ADD, which
 required changing so the current device could be updated by the
 fragment. [smf]

-converted cassette, pccard1 & pccard2 slots to use new MCFG macros [smf]

-Uses MCFG_SLOT_DEFAULT_OPTION instead of MCFG_DEVICE_SLOT_INTERFACE
 where only the default option is changed. [smf]

-m68k: add ability for externally-thrown bus errors to have proper
 details [R. Belmont]

-uses device_mconfig_additions() to add ata slots, which allows you to
 just add the device and configure it rather than using the
 MCFG_ATA_INTERFACE_ADD #define. [smf]

-allow building with ICL on Windows if you have it installed into MSVC [Dean London]
 The ICL compiler on Windows installs over MSVC and piggybacks onto the
 build tools Microsoft provide.  To enable compilation use USE_ICL=1
 when compiling with MSVC_BUILD=1 (from the ICL enabled command prompt)
 + gives a more stable build than the MSVC compiler + more informative
 compile errors when using ICL compared to MSVC compiler + can still
 use MSVC debugging tools (better than GCC) + can use additional intel
 tools etc.
 build is still slower than GCC one

-aristmk4.c:  [Lord-Data]
 * Option to raise outputs for physical meters to be used
 * Option to disable making sound effects for emulated meters
 * Option to disable virtual emulation of hopper/coin release system

-k005289.c: refactored, removed redundant state variables and
 unneccessary floating point math, added savestate support
 [Alex Jackson]

-Removed support for static config from slots and converted the two
 devices using it to machine config fragments [smf]

-Pong update: [couriersud]
 * based on feedback from IRC hopefully fixed issues like "jumping"
 * adjusted VR1 and VR2 to 50%
 * disabled all printf output.

-converted serial & rs232 devices to devcb2 [smf]

-diimage: Added load_software_region() function that loads a software
 list region into a shared_ptr. [Curt Coder]

-Added preliminary sound to ghosteo.c by borrowing code from vegaeo.c. [Osso]

-z8.c: Modernized cpu core.  [Wilbert Pol]

-midyunit.c  [Andy Welsh] 
 Fixed inputs and DIP Switches for hiimpact,
 shimpact and clones which were all imported from TROG and mostly
 incorrect.

-Added Signetics 8X300 microcontroller core, updated Wicat driver to
 use it.  [Barry Rodewald]

-replaced read rx/cts/dcd callbacks in ACIA6850 write write handlers,
 which allows multiple chips to be connected together without using
 glue methods. [smf]

-Changed Guitar Freaks 7m onwards to use a 32mb PCMCIA card [smf]

-Redumped some beatmania IIDX CD's [Guru]

-Redumped several Konami GV CD's [Guru]

-Redumped several Konami M2 CD's [Guru]

-Redumped various System 573 CD's [Guru]

-i8089: implement remaining instructions and support execution from
 "io" space. [Carl] 

-replaced read callbacks in I8251/Z80DART (and clones)/MC2661/
 MC68901/IM6402/MOS6551/Z80STI/MC6852/MC6854/ZX8302 with
 write handlers, which allows multiple chips to be connected
 together without using glue methods. [smf]

-Removed a load of unused code from MC68901, probably left
 over when it was converted to use diserial. [smf]

-Removed dependency clutter in c64 expansion port, c128 driver,
 ecbbus & econet [smf]
 
-nemesis.c: added PORT_TOGGLE and PORT_NAMEs to Konami GT.
 [baritonomarchetto]

-Rom locations added for Battles (Xevious bootleg), G.I. Joe,
 Ghosts'n Goblins (US), Victory Road and Guerilla War (Version
 1) as well as nvram location to The Simpsons.  [Kevin Eshbach]

-Added readmes for gijoe, moo, xexex, lethal, mystwarr also
 updating simpsons.  [Guru]
